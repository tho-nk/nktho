[{"content":"Overview This parser supports the PGN format based on Portable Game Notation. The movetext is based on SAN (Standard Algebraic Notation). Disambiguation is supported by checking VerifyIfKingBeingCheck before accepting a move.\nIt requires:\nCMake 3.22 GCC 12.1 and C++20 standard Ubuntu 22.04 or the Docker image iainttho/ubuntu:23.10.02 based on Ubuntu 23.10. The state of the board at the end of the game, in the form of an 8x8 grid:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 bR|bN|bB|bQ|bK|bB|bN|bR bP|bP|bP|bP|bP|bP|bP|bP | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | wP|wP|wP|wP|wP|wP|wP|wP wR|wN|wB|wQ|wK|wB|wN|wR Input 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 1. e4 e6 2. e5 f6 3. exf6 gxf6 4.

This leverages the CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern) to achieve a flexible and efficient solution. Polymorphism is implemented using std::visit, providing runtime polymorphism without relying on virtual functions and vtables.\nFor more insights, refer to the following resources:\nA Journey Into Non-Virtual Polymorphism in C++ - Rudyard Merriam - CppCon 2023 C++ : Polymorphic inheritance without vtable ","date":"2023-07-28T00:00:00Z","image":"https://www.nktho.fr/p/programation/eifel_hu5cc6d93db45cbbd6ae4d62acca4e5f7e_165761_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpeg","permalink":"https://www.nktho.fr/p/programation/","title":"PGN (Portable Game Notation) Parser"}]
